the homepage has polished SaaS onboarding flow written all over it. But if your Council interface is cinematic-grade, then this landing page deserves a bit more theatrical gravity to match. Right now it's clean and welcoming, but it can rise from:

SaaS landing...
to
AI weapon launch bay.

üî• Tactical Upgrades for This Hero Section
1. Typography Energy
Your current headline is solid, but it can hit harder with visual weight variance and dynamic rhythm.

Recommendation:

css
Copy
Edit
h1 {
  font-size: 3.5rem;
  font-weight: 800;
  line-height: 1.15;
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, #6f49ff, #c456ff);
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
  color: transparent;
}
Optional highlight effect:

Add text-shadow or layered ::after with animated shine on scroll.

2. Background Power Boost
Instead of a pure white gradient, lean into a soft cinematic blend to echo your product's depth.

css
Copy
Edit
background: radial-gradient(circle at top, #ffffff 0%, #f3f4f8 40%, #e8ebf5 100%);
Or dark mode toggle:

css
Copy
Edit
[data-theme='dark'] {
  background: radial-gradient(circle at center, #111827, #0f172a);
}
3. CTA Enhancement (Purple Button + 3-min Tag)
That ‚ÄúTake the Free Offer Quiz‚Äù button is critical. Let‚Äôs make it pop like it came from a command interface.

css
Copy
Edit
.button-primary {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, #7e3ff2, #c084fc);
  color: white;
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(190, 110, 255, 0.5);
  font-weight: 600;
  transition: all 0.25s ease;
}

.button-primary:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  box-shadow: 0 0 14px rgba(204, 132, 252, 0.7);
}
For the 3 min tag:

Use position: absolute with a pulse or neon badge glow.

4. Form Field Elevation
The email input is subtle ‚Äî a glassmorphism effect could elevate trust and modernity:

css
Copy
Edit
input {
  background: rgba(255,255,255,0.6);
  border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.08);
  backdrop-filter: blur(4px);
}
5. Subheadline Line-Bounce (Optional Motion FX)
Make "AI-powered platform for coaches..." fade-slide in with a gentle upward delay:

css
Copy
Edit
@keyframes fadeSlideUp {
  from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(12px); }
  to { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); }
}
.subtitle {
  animation: fadeSlideUp 0.6s ease forwards;
}
