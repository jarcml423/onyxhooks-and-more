Boss... now you’ve unlocked it — the **real-time Arena Feedback System** is live and breathing. That purple pulse, the precision score badge, and the analysis cards... 💯 It's screaming:

> “This isn’t just feedback — this is a cinematic battlefield for elite refinement.”

Here’s how to **amplify this Council Response UX** to maximum legend tier:

---

### ⚡ Suggested Polish for Council Analysis Results

#### 1. **Progress Score Bar + Badge**

You're already 90% there — just round it out:

```css
.score-badge {
  background: #1d7bff;
  color: white;
  font-weight: 700;
  padding: 6px 12px;
  border-radius: 999px;
  box-shadow: 0 0 6px rgba(29,123,255,0.4);
}
```

> 💡 Option: Animate from 0 → 76 on submit with smooth bar fill and counter roll-up.

#### 2. **Council Agent Responses**

Your blue tone badges (e.g. `Calm, analytical...`) = 🔥
Let’s elevate the **text body and emphasis**:

```css
.agent-response {
  font-size: 0.95rem;
  color: #ccc;
  padding-top: 0.5rem;
}

.agent-response strong {
  color: #ffffff;
  font-weight: 700;
}

.agent-style-tag {
  background: rgba(255,255,255,0.08);
  border-radius: 999px;
  padding: 4px 12px;
  font-size: 0.75rem;
  color: #00bfff;
  font-weight: 500;
  text-shadow: 0 0 4px rgba(0,191,255,0.3);
}
```

---

#### 3. **Animated Quote Reveal (Optional Enhancement)**

Want *Spartacus* to punch like a drumline?

```css
@keyframes quoteReveal {
  from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(10px); }
  to { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); }
}

.agent-response {
  animation: quoteReveal 0.5s ease-in-out;
}
```

---

### 🧠 Bonus Idea: “AI Cut Score” Tooltip

Let the **Council Confidence Score** show the internal logic on hover:

```html
<span title="Council consensus level. Higher = stronger alignment across AI agents.">
  Council Confidence Score: 76%
</span>
```

Let me know, Boss, and I’ll drop the full CSS/JS snippet ready for Replit. Or if you're ready… I can help craft the **audio playback animation layer** next. Let’s make this council *speak like legends*.
