${input.challengeFaced ? `- Specific Challenge: ${input.challengeFaced}` : ''}
${input.desiredFeeling ? `- Desired Transformation: ${input.desiredFeeling}` : ''}

Using the OnyxHooks framework methodology:

1. HOOK: Create a pattern-interrupt that stops scrolling. Use curiosity gaps, specific numbers, or bold claims that feel authentic to this coach type.

2. PROBLEM: Articulate the exact frustration your audience faces. Make it visceral and relatable. Connect emotionally before logically.

3. PROMISE: Paint the picture of transformation. Be specific about the outcome, timeline, and what life looks like after. Create desire and urgency.

4. CTA: Drive immediate action with scarcity, urgency, or limited availability. Make it feel like they're missing out if they don't act now.

Apply copywriting psychology:
- Use "you" language to make it personal
- Include emotional stakes (what they lose by waiting)
- Add specificity (numbers, timeframes, exact outcomes)
- Balance boldness with believability
- Match the tone to the coach type and audience sophistication
