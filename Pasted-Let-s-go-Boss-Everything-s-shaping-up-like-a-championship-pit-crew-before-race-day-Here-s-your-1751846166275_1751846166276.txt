// REPLIT PROMPT: Implement Quarterly NOS 9-Second Challenge + Leaderboard

1. 🔒 ADMIN SETTINGS:
   - Add a new boolean `isAdmin` flag to User schema.
   - Ensure current user (Boss) is flagged as admin at registration or seed time.

2. 🧠 CHALLENGE MODE:
   - Add a config flag `challengeActive` in the app config model.
   - Only allow access to Challenge Mode if `challengeActive === true`.
   - Challenge Mode has:
     ✅ 2 tries max per user (tracked per challenge cycle)
     ✅ Stopwatch auto-starts on hook form open
     ✅ NOS-style generate button triggers:
       → hook/offer generation
       → stopwatch stop
       → submit result to challenge backend with `{ userId, hook, offer, timeToGenerate }`

3. 📊 LEADERBOARD:
   - Create `ChallengeEntry` model with fields:
     - userId, displayName, timeToGenerate (in ms), challengeCycle (e.g., “Q3-2025”)
   - Leaderboard screen shows:
     - Top 25 performers sorted by `timeToGenerate ASC`
     - Challenge cycle countdown (e.g., “Challenge ends in 6d 04h”)
     - Your current rank (if submitted)
   - Limit challenge entries to users with Free or Starter Tier only (Pro gets no leaderboard benefits)

4. ⏱️ TIMER LOGIC:
   - Backend auto-generates current challenge cycle:
     → Format: Q{n}-{year}
     → Detect current quarter from `new Date()`
   - On challenge end (every 90 days), set `challengeActive = false` until next cycle.

5. 🧃 NOS EXPERIENCE:
   - Replace default “Generate” button with:
     → NOS bottle SVG or PNG icon (upload URL configurable)
     → On click: play .mp3 purge sound before generating
     → Optional toggle in User Settings: “NOS Sound FX: On/Off”

6. 🏁 UI UPDATES:
   - Add “9-Second Challenge” button on main dashboard when `challengeActive === true`
   - Leaderboard tab available to all tiers, but only Free/Starter can compete
   - Post-try animation: “🚀 You clocked in at 7.32s — Can you go faster?”

7. 🔐 ADMIN CONTROLS:
   - Admin dashboard toggle to manually enable/disable `challengeActive`
   - Admin can view all challenge entries (paginated + sortable by tier or score)

📆 Challenge Timing Rules Recap:
