# Railway Deployment Fix Package

## Problem Solved
Railway deployment was failing due to:
1. **Replit-specific plugins** in vite.config.ts that don't exist on npm
2. **Missing Node.js version** specification for Railway
3. **Puppeteer dependency** causing Chrome installation issues during build

## Files in This Package

### 1. `package.json` - Railway-Compatible Dependencies
- **Added:** Node.js 20.x version specification in engines
- **Removed:** All Replit-specific devDependencies that cause build failures
- **Removed:** Puppeteer (use html2canvas for PDF generation instead)
- **Kept:** All essential dependencies for full platform functionality

### 2. `vite.config.ts` - Clean Vite Configuration
- **Removed:** @replit/vite-plugin-cartographer (doesn't exist on npm)
- **Removed:** @replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal (doesn't exist on npm)
- **Kept:** Essential React plugin and path configurations
- **Maintained:** All alias configurations for proper imports

## Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Upload These Files to GitHub
1. Download this entire `railway-deployment-fix` folder
2. Replace your existing `package.json` with the one from this package
3. Replace your existing `vite.config.ts` with the one from this package
4. Commit and push to GitHub

### Step 2: Verify Railway Environment Variables
Ensure these 22 environment variables are configured in Railway:
- DATABASE_URL (PostgreSQL connection)
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- SENDGRID_API_KEY  
- ZOHO_EMAIL_USER, ZOHO_EMAIL_PASS
- Firebase config (6 variables)
- reCAPTCHA keys (2 variables)
- All other variables from railway-secrets.env

### Step 3: Add Missing Stripe Keys
Only 2 variables still needed:
- `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (from Stripe Dashboard → Developers → API Keys)
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (from Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks)

## Expected Result
After uploading these files:
- ✅ Railway build should complete successfully
- ✅ All dependencies will install without errors
- ✅ Frontend will build with clean Vite configuration
- ✅ Backend will bundle correctly with esbuild
- ✅ Application will deploy to your custom domain
- ✅ All platform functionality preserved

## Technical Changes Made

### Removed Dependencies:
- `@replit/vite-plugin-cartographer` - Replit-specific, not available on npm
- `@replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal` - Replit-specific, not available on npm
- `puppeteer` - Causes Chrome dependency issues on Railway

### Added Configuration:
- `"engines": {"node": "20.x", "npm": "10.x"}` - Railway compatibility
- Clean Vite plugin array without Replit dependencies

### Maintained Features:
- All UI components and React functionality
- Express server and API endpoints
- Database integration with Drizzle ORM
- Authentication with Firebase
- Payment processing with Stripe
- Email services with SendGrid
- All styling with Tailwind CSS

## Support
If deployment still fails after using these files, check:
1. Railway service logs for specific error messages
2. Environment variables are properly configured
3. GitHub repository has the updated files
4. Railway is using the latest commit
