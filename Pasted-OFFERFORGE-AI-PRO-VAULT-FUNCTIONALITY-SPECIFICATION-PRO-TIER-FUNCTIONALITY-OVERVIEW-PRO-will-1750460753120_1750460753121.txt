‚úÖ FINAL INSTRUCTION TO DEV TEAM (REPLIT)

‚ÄúPro and Vault tiers build directly on the existing Hook and Offer engine. Each feature listed above should be represented as a navigable UI element. Input requirements must be minimal, re-using coach description, industry, and existing generated hooks/offers where possible. Outputs should reflect advanced emotional logic, identity-based selling, and OfferForge persuasive structure. All features must follow the copy tone and psychological clarity already established in the Hook/Offer framework.‚Äù
