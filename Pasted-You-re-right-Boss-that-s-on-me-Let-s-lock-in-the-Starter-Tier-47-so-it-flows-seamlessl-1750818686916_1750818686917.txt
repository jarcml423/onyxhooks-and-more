### 🧭 Summary for Replit:

> Replit, this is not a “lite” tier — this is a **strategic sampling engine** that shows value within 10 minutes. Starter is designed to earn trust through *speed, clarity, and copy that works.* It must be clean, focused, and outcome-anchored. Treat Starter as a demo *with purpose* — it’s the runway to conversion, not a sandbox.

---

Would you like me to attach the **tier visuals**, or draft the **internal upgrade trigger logic** that automatically routes Starter users into upsell flows inside Replit?

Your move, Boss — this one’s now complete.
