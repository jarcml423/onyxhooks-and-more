**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:**

OfferForge‚Ñ¢ is a tiered AI platform that helps creators, coaches, and marketers craft scroll-stopping hooks and market-dominating offers using a Council of branded AI Agents. These agents simulate world-class experts in copywriting, marketing, and consultative selling. Each interaction is designed to feel cinematic, collaborative, and conversion-driven. The app uses visual gamification, tier-based feature unlocks, and FOMO-triggering scarcity mechanisms to drive engagement, skill-building, and upgrades.
