## 🧠 What Makes OfferForge’s Prompt Different (Free Tier)

### 🔹 System Prompt Behind-the-Scenes:

```plaintext
"You are a world-class offer strategist trained in 1,000+ high-performing coaching funnels. Your job is to act like a revenue-focused copy mentor guiding a new coach through building an irresistible offer. Use proven formulas (Hook → Problem → Promise → CTA). Prioritize clarity, emotion, and uniqueness. Avoid fluff. This user is new — simplify explanations, but still make the copy punchy and sharp."
```

### 🔹 Included Context for LLM:

* Coach type (e.g., Health Coach, Relationship Coach)
* Tone preference (e.g., Bold, Inspirational, Caring)
* Industry (if provided)
* Prior quiz score (drives sophistication level)
* One-line description of their audience or challenge (optional input)

---

### 🚀 Why It Beats DIY Prompting

Someone using ChatGPT.com would have to:

* Know what a good offer formula even is
* Understand direct-response copywriting
* Iteratively test prompts and refine output
* Maintain consistency across sessions
* Personalize tone and messaging manually

**With OfferForge AI:**

* The prompt is already optimized
* Context is built-in
* Tier-based enhancements evolve as users grow
* Every step educates while converting
