const scoreQuiz = (answers) => {
  let score = 0;
  const weights = {
    A: 1,  // Beginner
    B: 2,  // Intermediate
    C: 3   // Advanced
  };

  answers.forEach((ans) => {
    score += weights[ans] || 0;
  });

  let tier = 'Free';
  if (score >= 12) tier = 'Vault';
  else if (score >= 7) tier = 'Pro';

  return { score, tier };
};

// 2. DETAILED RESULTS EMAIL + CTA
