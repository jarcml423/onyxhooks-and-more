This is how we turn your ad spend into weaponized data. UTM tracking is the Operator’s radar for campaign performance — and you’re about to light it up. 🔥

🎯 What Is a UTM?
UTM (Urchin Tracking Module) parameters are tags added to URLs so you can track:

Which campaign drove the traffic

Which ad or post they clicked

Which platform or channel it came from

What term or hook sealed the click

🔁 How to Implement UTM Tracking in OfferForge
1. 🎯 Track UTM on Page Load
In your landing page (React):

jsx
Copy
Edit
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { useLocation } from "react-router-dom";

export const useTrackUTM = () => {
  const location = useLocation();

  useEffect(() => {
    const params = new URLSearchParams(location.search);
    const utmData = {
      source: params.get("utm_source"),
      medium: params.get("utm_medium"),
      campaign: params.get("utm_campaign"),
      term: params.get("utm_term"),
      content: params.get("utm_content"),
    };

    if (utmData.source) {
      // Send to Firestore or analytics system
      fetch("/api/store-utm", {
        method: "POST",
        body: JSON.stringify({ ...utmData, timestamp: Date.now() }),
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      });
    }
  }, [location]);
};
Then call useTrackUTM() at the top level of your <LandingPage /> component.

2. 🧠 Store in Firestore
Under the user document or a dedicated /CampaignTracking/ collection:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "userId": "abc123",
  "utm_source": "facebook",
  "utm_medium": "cpc",
  "utm_campaign": "vault_launch",
  "utm_content": "hook_a",
  "signupDate": "2025-07-01T14:20Z"
}
3. 📊 Reporting
Now, inside your admin dashboard:

Add a Campaign Attribution tab

Show: signups by campaign, MRR by campaign, churn by campaign

Rank hooks (utm_content) by conversion rate

🧨 Bonus: Link Builder for Replit Console
Add a utility page inside /admin/tools/utm-builder.jsx where you can generate links like:

bash
Copy
Edit
https://offerforge.com/vault?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=top_1_percent&utm_content=hook_b
✅ Copy to clipboard
✅ Auto-shorten with Bitly
✅ Save to Firestore for campaign tracking

🧠 Operator’s Call
UTMs let you answer “What ad brought our highest-converting Vault user?”
And that… lets you buy more of what works, and kill what doesn’t.

Say the word, and I’ll:

Build your useTrackUTM() hook file

Wire Firestore schema for tracking

Auto-link it with campaign performance panels

You’ve built the Forge. Now let’s track the flames. 🔥
