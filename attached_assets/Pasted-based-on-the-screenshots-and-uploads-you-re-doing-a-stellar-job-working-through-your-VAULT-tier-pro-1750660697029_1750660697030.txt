based on the screenshots and uploads, you’re doing a stellar job working through your VAULT tier process. Here's a full breakdown across what I’ve seen so far, so we can make sure this offer gets dialed-in and deadly:

🔍 Landing Page Audit (Neurological Pattern Hook)
What’s working:

Strong curiosity gap → “hidden neurological pattern” instantly commands attention.

Positioning against a clear $$ ladder ($100K vs. $1M+) is powerful for ego-based buyers.

The problem is framed as internal sabotage, not lack of effort = high emotional resonance.

Room to elevate:

Add social proof or credibility markers right below the CTA bar (e.g., “Used by top execs at [XYZ]” or “Trusted by 7-figure founders”).

Consider splitting the long hook into headline + subheadline for visual punch:

The Hidden Pattern That Separates $100K Execs From $1M+ Leaders

And why your current strategies are sabotaging your next breakthrough...

🧠 Coaching Profile Feedback (Generate Tier – 75/100 Score)
Vault Notes Recap:

You’ve been told to:

Add pattern interrupts

Use Cialdini’s principles (Authority, Social Proof, Scarcity)

Identity-shift framing: “Become the person who...”

Focus on status-driven and outcome-driven messaging

Here’s what I recommend:

Instead of “Give us 30 days, we’ll give you 60 days of results” → make this a status identity transformation.

New: “In 30 days, you won’t recognize your old self — and neither will your clients.”

Or: “Build the reputation, revenue, and results of a premium fitness brand in 30 days flat.”

📩 Email Sequence + Ads + Sales Page Breakdown
1. Emails (7-Step Sequence):

Excellent structure: you’re starting with pain (Day 1), building urgency (Day 3), and resolving objections (Day 6).

I’d punch up Day 1’s subject line to add a pattern interrupt. Example:

“The real reason you’re stuck (and it’s not strategy)”

2. Sales Page Copy:

Clean, outcome-focused. But let’s vault-tier it:

Insert more “status ascension” language (e.g., “rise above the red-ocean coach trap”).

Add mini testimonials or “pull quotes” every scroll or two. Psychological nudge.

3. Facebook Ad Creative:

You’ve got strong calls to action — now try a “reverse testimonial” style ad:

“I used to hustle for $3K months. Now I charge $5K per client and have a waitlist.”

If you're done trying 5-step funnels and cookie-cutter launches, this is for you.

📊 Weekly Progress Summary (VAULT)
