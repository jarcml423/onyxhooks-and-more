ENHANCED COUNCIL SCORING FLOW (PRO & VAULT)
🧑‍⚖️ STEP 1: Council Review & Scoring
Each active Council agent evaluates the Hook or Offer using the predefined scorecard.

Pro Tier → 3 Council Agents (e.g., Sabien, Blaze, Mosaic)

Vault Tier → Full Council (5 core + Michael)

Each agent returns:

A score per dimension

A short justification note

A revision suggestion (if the score is under 90)

Example (from Sabien):

Clarity: 18/20 – “Almost perfect, but consider shortening the lead phrase.”

Urgency: 15/20 – “Add a time-based driver like ‘before July 1’.”

The system averages all agent scores to calculate the final composite.

🧮 STEP 2: Michael Interprets Scores + ROI Lens
Michael (the Closer) steps in to analyze the overall scoring:

Highlights what’s holding back conversion

Points out deal-breaking gaps in trust, urgency, or ROI framing

Determines if this asset is "launchable" or needs rewrites

Michael:
“This hook gets an 86 overall. The clarity and pain are strong, but the urgency is flat. If this were on a landing page, it would underperform.”

🔁 STEP 3: Alex Rebuilds to a 100
Alex receives the original hook + Council composite + Michael’s closing feedback.

He then:

Rewrites the hook or offer to aim for a 95–100 score

Explains why this version wins (based on frameworks + heuristics)

Outputs 2 upgraded versions (e.g., one for ads, one for email)

Alex:
“Let’s sharpen the contrast. Add ‘…before your next client call’ and frame the result. Boom — now it pops.
Here’s your version for IG Reels and your version for landing page H1.”

🧪 STEP 4: Coach Sees Side-by-Side
Final Output for the Coach:

Original	Council Score	Alex Upgrade	Upgrade Score
Hook	“Stop losing clients…”	86	“Stop losing clients before they even book. Fix this 10-second flaw.”	97

CTA: “Use Alex’s version — it hits faster, scores higher, and converts better.”

🔒 VAULT EXCLUSIVE BONUS
Alex gives tactical test recommendation

“A/B test this hook vs original on ads. Watch CTR shift.”

Michael adds objection pre-handling or risk reversal enhancement
