Here’s the ready-to-send Replit prompt that adds the full VaultForge Guidance Checkpoint system before unlocking any Next Best Action:

📦 Replit Implementation Prompt: VaultForge Guidance Checkpoint Flow
Objective:
Introduce a mandatory “Guidance Check” after the offer is forged, and before users can access “Next Best Actions” like building ad campaigns or email sequences. This ensures the generated offer is tailored, accurate, and aligned to the user’s real business.

✅ New Flow: VaultForge Guidance Check (UX Modal Layer)
Trigger Point:
After “Offer Complete” screen loads and before enabling the Next Best Actions section.

Modal Title:
🎯 Guidance Check: Let’s Review Before You Launch

Modal Description:
"Your offer is forged, but before we launch ads or emails, let’s make sure it’s aligned with YOU. VaultForge will help check:"

✅ Tone of Voice (Does this sound like you or a placeholder?)

✅ Proof Accuracy (Are results truly yours?)

✅ Niche Fit (Is the message relevant to your business model?)

✅ Funnel Alignment (Is the CTA pushing toward the correct action?)

🧪 Modal Buttons:
Button Text	Action
Run Guidance Check	Launchs inline validation assistant (see below)
Skip for Now	Bypasses check, proceeds to Next Best Actions

🧠 Inline Guidance Check Logic:
Voice Match Prompt:
"Does this offer reflect your personal tone or sound like a generic template?"

Yes, it matches → ✅

No, help me rewrite → Opens inline editor with editable fields for tone/style

Niche Check:
"Is this offer relevant to your industry or coaching focus?"

Yes → ✅

No → Triggers prompt with dropdown of popular coaching industries (e.g., Fitness, Business, Mindset, Relationship), regenerates contextual copy

Proof Validation:
"Is this your actual proof/testimonial or a placeholder?"

Yes, it's mine → ✅

No, help me revise → Offers proof-style templates to insert actual metrics, testimonials, or transformation data

CTA Goal Check:
"What action should your reader take after reading this offer?"

Options: Book a Call, Download a Lead Magnet, Join Webinar, Buy Now

If CTA and chosen goal misalign → Rewrites CTA accordingly

🧩 Developer Notes:
All checks should be modular and reusable across other workflows (email sequence, landing page, ad builder)

Edits made in Guidance Check auto-update VaultForge’s current offer object

“Next Best Action” buttons should remain disabled until either:

All 4 checks are ✅, or

User explicitly chooses “Skip for Now”
