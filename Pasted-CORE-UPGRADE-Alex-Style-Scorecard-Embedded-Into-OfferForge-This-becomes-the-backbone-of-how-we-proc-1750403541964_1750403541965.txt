CORE UPGRADE: Alex-Style Scorecard Embedded Into OfferForge
This becomes the backbone of how we process, evaluate, and re-score every Hook and Offer — repeatably, reliably, and with optimization pathways baked in.

✅ HOOK SCORING PROTOCOL (100-Point Scale)
Each hook is scored across 5 predefined dimensions:

Dimension	Description	Max Score
Clarity	Can a 5th grader understand it instantly? No fluff, no jargon.	20
Curiosity	Does it open a loop or spark desire to know more?	20
Relevance	Does it speak directly to the reader’s pain, goal, or problem?	20
Urgency	Is there a sense of “this matters NOW”? Time-framed or implied scarcity?	20
Specificity	Does it include facts, numbers, contrast, or sharp visual clarity?	20

➡ Total: /100

💰 OFFER SCORING PROTOCOL (100-Point Scale)
Based on the Hormozi Value Equation + strategic offer stack logic:

Dimension	Description	Max Score
Dream Outcome	Is the outcome big, believable, and emotionally powerful?	20
Likelihood of Success	Is it believable that they’ll get the outcome? Testimonials? Guarantees?	15
Time to Results	Is it fast? Can they see value quickly?	15
Effort & Sacrifice	Is it frictionless? How hard is it to complete?	10
Risk Reversal	Do they lose anything if it fails? Refunds? Try before buy?	10
Value Stack	Bonuses, templates, toolkits? Is this offer “stacked”?	10
Price Framing	ROI clear? Smart comparison (vs $x/hr coach, vs DIY)?	10
Messaging Clarity	Is the copy crisp, no jargon, and audience-aligned?	10

➡ Total: /100
