SUBJECT: URGENT: Custom Domain 404 Error - Load Balancer Routing Failure (3+ Days)

Dear Replit Technical Support Team,

I am writing to report a critical deployment infrastructure issue that has blocked production deployment for 3+ days.

**PROJECT DETAILS:**
- Project: onyx-hooks-onyxhooks
- Custom Domain: www.onyxnpearls.com
- Deployment Type: Autoscale
- Account: Core/Premium tier

**ISSUE DESCRIPTION:**
Custom domain returns 404 "Not Found" despite successful domain verification and SSL certificate issuance. The application works perfectly locally but fails to route through the custom domain.

**TECHNICAL STATUS:**
✅ DNS CNAME: www.onyxnpearls.com → onyx-hooks-onyxhooks.replit.app
✅ SSL Certificate: Issued and operational (HTTP/2 responses)
✅ Domain Verification: Completed in deployment settings
✅ Application: Serving correctly on localhost:5000 (HTTP 200)
❌ Custom Domain: Returns HTTP/2 404 "Not Found"

**DIAGNOSTIC EVIDENCE:**
```
curl -I http://localhost:5000/
# Returns: HTTP/1.1 200 OK with full application

curl -I https://www.onyxnpearls.com/
# Returns: HTTP/2 404 with "Not Found"
```

**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:**
This appears to be a load balancer routing failure where:
1. SSL termination works correctly
2. Domain verification is successful
3. Application container is running and healthy
4. Routing between custom domain and application container fails

**BUSINESS IMPACT:**
Production deployment blocked for 3+ days. Application is fully production-ready but inaccessible to users via custom domain.

**REQUEST:**
Immediate investigation of load balancer routing configuration for www.onyxnpearls.com to onyx-hooks-onyxhooks deployment.

This is a confirmed infrastructure issue requiring platform team intervention.

Thank you for urgent assistance.
