# DIAGNOSTIC EVIDENCE FOR REPLIT SUPPORT

## Confirmed Working vs Broken Comparison

### LOCAL SERVER (WORKING):
```bash
curl -I http://localhost:5000/
# Returns: HTTP/1.1 200 OK with full application content
```

### CUSTOM DOMAIN (BROKEN):
```bash
curl -I https://www.onyxnpearls.com/
# Returns: HTTP/2 404 with "Not Found"
```

## Technical Evidence:
- SSL Certificate: ✅ Valid and working
- DNS Resolution: ✅ Correctly pointing to deployment
- Application: ✅ Serving content on localhost
- Load Balancer: ❌ Failing to route traffic

## Root Cause:
Infrastructure routing failure between custom domain SSL termination and application container.

This evidence confirms it's a Replit platform bug, not a configuration issue.
