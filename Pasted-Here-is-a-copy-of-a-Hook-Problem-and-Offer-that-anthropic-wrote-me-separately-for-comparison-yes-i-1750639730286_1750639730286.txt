Here is a copy of a Hook, Problem and Offer that anthropic wrote me separately for comparison: yes it's rather long, but seems to be much more heavily tied in to my business and fitness customers needed.  Wouldn't you agree?# THE EXECUTIVE PHYSIQUE METHOD
## *How Georgia's Top Professionals Are Building Championship Bodies Without Sacrificing Their Corner Office*

---

## THE HOOK
**"I'll show you how to build a bodybuilder's physique working just 4 hours per week – even if you're pulling 60-hour weeks, have zero time to meal prep, and think your genetics suck."**

*(And I'll prove it works in the next 90 days or you don't pay a dime)*

## THE PROBLEM THEY'RE FACING

You're crushing it in the boardroom but getting crushed in the mirror.

You used to be the guy who could eat pizza at midnight and still see abs. Now you look at a donut and gain 3 pounds.

Here's what's really happening:
- You're working 12-hour days but your workouts are getting weaker and shorter
- You skip meals all day then binge eat at 9 PM because you're starving
- You've tried every "busy professional" workout plan but they're all designed by 22-year-old trainers who've never had a real job
- Your testosterone is tanking from stress and poor sleep
- You feel like a fraud wearing expensive suits to hide a dad bod

**The brutal truth?** You're not out of shape because you're busy. You're out of shape because no one's shown you how to build muscle and burn fat using the same systems that made you successful in business.

---

## THEIR GOAL

**What you actually want:** To walk into any room with the quiet confidence that comes from having a body that commands respect – without becoming a slave to the gym or living on chicken and rice.

**Specifically, you want to:**
- Add 15-25 lbs of lean muscle while dropping 20-40 lbs of fat
- Fit perfectly into that expensive suit collection (maybe even buy a size smaller)
- Have more energy at 3 PM than most people have at 9 AM
- Build a physique that makes people assume you're an athlete, not just another executive
- Create a sustainable system that works even during your busiest quarters

**The real goal?** You want to be the guy who "has it all" – not just financially, but physically too.
