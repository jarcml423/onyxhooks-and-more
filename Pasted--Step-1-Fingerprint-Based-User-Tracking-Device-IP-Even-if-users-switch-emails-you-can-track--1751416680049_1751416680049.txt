🔐 Step 1: Fingerprint-Based User Tracking (Device + IP)
Even if users switch emails, you can track:

✅ Device Fingerprinting
Use a tool like FingerprintJS (free plan available)

Generates a unique hash per device/browser (90–99% accuracy)

js
Copy
Edit
import FingerprintJS from '@fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs';

const fpPromise = FingerprintJS.load();

fpPromise.then(fp => fp.get()).then(result => {
  const visitorId = result.visitorId;
  // Send to Firestore on signup
});
🔥 What to do with it:

Store visitorId in Firestore with their account

If a new signup uses the same fingerprint: block or limit hooks

Prevent more than 1 free account per device

🌐 Step 2: IP Address Monitoring
Log IP address on signup (even approximate is helpful)

Rate-limit new free accounts per IP per day (e.g., max 2 per 24 hrs)

js
Copy
Edit
// In backend (Firebase Function or Replit API)
if (ipAlreadyUsedToday(ip) && userTier === 'free') {
  denySignup("Multiple accounts from same IP in 24h.");
}
Use request.headers['x-forwarded-for'] in your function to pull the IP.

📧 Step 3: Email Quality + Disposable Email Detection
Use an API like Kickbox, NeverBounce, or open-source lists to block:

Disposable services (Mailinator, TempMail, etc.)

Recently flagged burner domains

🔥 Alternative: Use email-verifier.io or write your own regex match on known services.

🎯 Step 4: Phone Verification for High-Value Features
If you want to lock down even harder (e.g. Vault), require SMS verification (Twilio or Firebase Phone Auth).

⚖️ Step 5: Credit Degradation or Delayed Hook Activation
Add a delay (e.g. 15 minutes) for free-tier hook credits to activate

Penalize new devices that resemble previously flagged ones

Gradually give credits over time (1 credit every 12 hrs up to 5 total)

📊 Step 6: Admin Monitor: Abuse Dashboard
Add a panel to /admin/security:

🚨 Same fingerprint on multiple accounts

🚨 3+ free accounts from same IP

🚨 Suspicious domain pattern (e.g., random123@mailinator.com)

Final Layer: Manual Review Escalation
If your system flags a suspicious user:

Throttle hook access

Show CAPTCHA before every use

Route to admin for tier review
