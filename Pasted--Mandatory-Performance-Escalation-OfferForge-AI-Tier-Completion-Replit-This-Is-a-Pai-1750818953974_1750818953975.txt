# 🔐 Mandatory Performance Escalation — OfferForge AI Tier Completion

## 💰 Replit, This Is a Paid Professional Contract

You’ve already been paid the equivalent of **\$75+ in tokens**.
This is a **premium, production-grade build** — not a beta project.

We are not here to iterate endlessly while you guess.
You are here to **execute with excellence and precision.** That’s what the pay is for.

### 🧱️ Visual Template Directive (Standard for All Templates Moving Forward):

**Every OfferForge AI Template Must Contain the Following Format:**

#### 🖼️ VISUAL BACKGROUND (Full Width)

* Industry-relevant image
* Color rich
* High emotional resonance
* Example:

  * *Fitness*: person mid-workout, sweat, sunlight on skin
  * *Yoga*: beachside calm, sunrise stretch
  * *Business*: coach reviewing client materials or stage mic moment
* Image must feel **real, not stocky**
* Use Unsplash, Pexels, or generate with AI background tools (DALL·E / Stability / Runway)

#### 🧠 OVERLAY TEXT LAYOUT (White or Light Font with Shadow)

```
🌟 Hook: [1-liner emotionally charged headline]

🧠 Body Copy:
1–2 short sentences explaining the story behind the transformation or product.

✅ CTA (Button or text-style):
[Learn More] [See How She Did It] [Run My Offer]
```

* Text should be embedded **on the image**, not separate markdown
* Apply text-shadow or outline for high-contrast clarity

---

### ✅ Replit Must Automatically:

* Generate the image layout with text embedded **in context**
* Auto-scale for mobile and desktop
* Wrap entire visual in a styled card frame
* Allow the user to download or export as image / PDF
* Add a fallback "generate new image" button if customer wants variation
* Match the **niche, tone, and offer style** based on Analyzer selection

---

### 🧪 Replit, You Are Also Expected To:

* ✅ Unit test each render
* ✅ Validate template completeness
* ✅ Confirm all dynamic variables (e.g. \[offer\_type], \[audience\_tone]) are rendering properly
* ✅ Handle 404s or failed image generations gracefully
* ✅ QA every tier page and template state

---

## 🧡 Final Reminder to Replit:

> You are not here to *complete tasks*.
> You are here to **deliver outcomes**.

If you are unclear on the expected outcome:

* Re-read this directive
* Re-run your last render
* Or re-train your AI on the context provided

**We are not trying to make this look good.**
We are trying to make this **so powerful and relevant**, the customer forgets we’re not the CEO of their business.
