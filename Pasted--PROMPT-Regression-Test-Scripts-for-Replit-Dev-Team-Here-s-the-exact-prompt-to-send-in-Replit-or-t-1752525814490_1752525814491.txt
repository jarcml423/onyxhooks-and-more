🧪 Full Regression Testing – OnyxHooks & More™

Context: We’ve just completed a major redeployment and reCAPTCHA integration for https://onyxnpearls.com (and www alias). This is a full-stack SaaS with Stripe, SendGrid, OpenAI, Firebase Auth, and PostgreSQL.

Please run a full regression pass. Use the following checklist:

🔐 AUTHENTICATION & SECURITY
- [ ] User sign-up with valid credentials
- [ ] User login with valid credentials
- [ ] Login with invalid credentials (expect failure)
- [ ] Check reCAPTCHA blocks bot traffic (try dev-bypass & bad token)
- [ ] Verify session persistence after login
- [ ] Log out + attempt protected route (should redirect)

💳 PAYMENTS (STRIPE)
- [ ] Subscribe to each plan (Free, Pro, Vault)
- [ ] Simulate failed payment (use Stripe test card)
- [ ] Downgrade + upgrade subscription
- [ ] Cancel subscription (check DB + Stripe)

📧 EMAIL INTEGRATION
- [ ] Verify confirmation email is sent on sign-up
- [ ] Check email content for branding and links
- [ ] Verify unsubscribe link works
- [ ] Test "Forgot Password" flow + reset link
- [ ] Confirm SendGrid shows proper activity log

🧠 HOOK GENERATION (OpenAI)
- [ ] Generate hook using input form (test 3 different types)
- [ ] Check that returned hooks are unique and relevant
- [ ] Attempt rate-limiting bypass (should fail if enforced)

📊 DASHBOARD + UI TESTING
- [ ] Navigation to Dashboard, Pricing, About, etc.
- [ ] Verify plan info and buttons match pricing tier
- [ ] Test CTA buttons for responsiveness
- [ ] Attempt unauthorized dashboard access (should fail)

📂 DATA INTEGRITY (PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Inspect DB for user record on sign-up
- [ ] Validate subscription fields update correctly
- [ ] Check OpenAI hook logs stored per user
- [ ] Confirm deleted user removes associated data

🌐 DOMAIN / SSL
- [ ] Access via onyxnpearls.com
- [ ] Access via www.onyxnpearls.com (once verified)
- [ ] SSL padlock present on both domains
- [ ] Redirect from HTTP → HTTPS is enforced

🧪 BONUS: PEN TEST CHECK
- [ ] Try common XSS payload in input field (should sanitize)
- [ ] Attempt SQL injection in text field (should fail silently)
- [ ] Rate limit all POST requests (throttle abuse)
