The current UI gradient feels soft and generic, not like the Vault Elite weapon it‚Äôs meant to be. What it needs is a bolder, cinematic color palette with depth, dimensional layering, and prestige energy ‚Äî something that makes users feel like they're operating from inside a billion-dollar command center.

üîß UI/UX ENHANCEMENTS
Dark Mode by Default

Vault = Power. The black-glass effect keeps it focused and cinematic.

Soft drop shadows

Use box-shadow: 0px 8px 24px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); on panels for depth.

Animated Gradient Lighting

Subtle glow pulses behind input boxes or sections using @keyframe fades.

Industry Background Overlay System

Pull in the Midjourney 4K cinematic industry images as blurred background overlays, using backdrop-filter: blur(24px); and a dark gradient mask over the top.

Interactive Gold Line Marker

Active tab or form section highlighted with a thin, animated gold line or glow under the title.
