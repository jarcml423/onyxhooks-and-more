## Issue Identified
Based on Replit documentation research, this is a known issue: "Random 404 errors may indicate load balancer problems - Works on `replit.app` domain but fails on custom domain"

## Solution Steps
1. Remove custom domain completely from deployment
2. Wait 5 minutes for DNS cache clearing
3. Re-add domain with fresh routing configuration
4. Trigger new SSL certificate issuance
5. Test routing after propagation

## Support Ticket Created
- Detailed technical documentation prepared
- Priority: High (3+ day production blocker)
- Account: Core tier requiring immediate escalation

## Next Actions
