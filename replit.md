# OnyxHooks & More‚Ñ¢ - Replit Configuration

## Overview

OnyxHooks & More‚Ñ¢ is a comprehensive SaaS platform designed for coaches, course creators, and service providers to generate and optimize high-converting digital offers. The application combines AI-powered offer generation, funnel analysis, ROI simulation, and a referral system to help users create profitable digital products. Tagline: "Since there's more to fishing than just hooks."

## System Architecture

### Full-Stack Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, using Vite for development and building
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript support
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication with Google OAuth support
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe integration for subscription management
- **Email Service**: Resend/Mailgun for transactional emails
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o for content generation and analysis

### Monorepo Structure
The application follows a monorepo pattern with shared code:
- `client/` - React frontend application
- `server/` - Express.js backend
- `shared/` - Common schemas and types used by both frontend and backend

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, React Context for auth
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization

### Backend Architecture
- **API Structure**: RESTful endpoints with Express.js
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- **AI Services**: OpenAI integration for offer generation and analysis
- **Email Services**: Abstracted email service supporting multiple providers
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe webhooks and subscription management

### Database Schema
The application uses a comprehensive PostgreSQL schema including:
- **Users**: Authentication, subscription status, usage tracking
- **Offers**: Generated offers with metadata and performance data
- **Funnel Reviews**: AI-powered funnel analysis and critiques
- **ROI Simulations**: Financial modeling and projections
- **Quiz Results**: Assessment scores and recommendations
- **Referrals**: Referral tracking and commission management
- **Agency Clients**: Multi-client management for agency users

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. Firebase handles user authentication (email/password or Google OAuth)
2. Backend creates/updates user records in PostgreSQL
3. JWT tokens manage session state
4. Role-based access control for feature gating

### AI Generation Flow
1. User submits niche and transformation details
2. Backend calls OpenAI API with structured prompts
3. AI generates offers with headlines, benefits, and pricing
4. Results stored in database and returned to frontend
5. Usage tracking updated for subscription limits

### Payment Flow
1. Stripe Elements handles secure payment collection
2. Webhooks update subscription status
3. User role and limits updated based on subscription tier
4. Email notifications sent for successful upgrades

## External Dependencies

### Core Services
- **OpenAI API**: GPT-4o for content generation and analysis
- **Firebase Auth**: User authentication and management
- **Stripe**: Payment processing and subscription management
- **Resend/Mailgun**: Email delivery services
- **Neon Database**: Managed PostgreSQL hosting

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Frontend build tool and development server
- **Drizzle Kit**: Database migrations and schema management
- **ESBuild**: Backend bundling for production
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the entire stack

## Deployment Strategy

### Replit Configuration
- **Environment**: Node.js 20 with PostgreSQL 16
- **Development**: `npm run dev` starts both frontend and backend
- **Production Build**: Vite builds frontend, ESBuild bundles backend
- **Port Configuration**: Development on 5000, production on 80
- **Auto-scaling**: Configured for autoscale deployment target

### Build Process
1. Frontend built with Vite to `dist/public`
2. Backend bundled with ESBuild to `dist/index.js`
3. Static files served by Express in production
4. Database migrations run via Drizzle Kit

### Environment Variables
Required environment variables include:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API access
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Stripe payment processing
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Email service API key
- Firebase configuration variables

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

**Development Standards:**
- Always perform comprehensive environment validation before troubleshooting
- Trace all configuration variables across frontend/backend to identify conflicts
- Verify external service configurations (domain mappings, API versions) in live environments
- Conduct full system audits to catch legacy configuration remnants from previous projects
- Prioritize prevention through thorough verification over reactive symptom fixes
- **CRITICAL**: Examine actual technical details (DNS targets, API responses, configuration values) rather than relying on visual indicators or status messages
- **VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT**: Always verify that DNS CNAME records point to the specific deployment URL (onyx-hooks-onyxhooks.replit.app) not generic targets (cname.replit.com)
- **CONSERVATIVE ANALYSIS**: Provide evidence-based assessments with conservative timing estimates rather than optimistic predictions
